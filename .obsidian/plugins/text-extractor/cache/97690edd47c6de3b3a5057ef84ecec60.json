February Diet 2 Continued Overleaf/ Question 1 – Algorithms, Searching & Sorting, and Complexity (20 marks in total) 1. (a) Consider the following algorithm some_algo described in pseudocode. It takes as input an array array of integers and it (creates and) returns a list output. It internally also uses a Boolean variable test and two integer variables i and j. define some_algo (array) output = [] for i from 0 to length(array)-1 j = 0 test = TRUE while (test == TRUE) AND (j < length(output)) if output[j] == array[i] test = FALSE j = j + 1 if (test == TRUE) output.append(array[i]) return output Answer the following questions regarding the some_algo algorithm above: (i) What is the output of the algorithm when run on input [1, 2, 1, 3]? [3 marks] (ii) In one sentence, describe what the algorithm does. That is, given a certain input, how does this algorithm transform it? (Note that you are not asked to describe what the code does line-by-line.) [3 marks] (iii) Which of the following characterize the (worst-case, asymptotic) running time of the algorithm? Explain your answer and, additionally, give an example of a worst-case input that forces the algorithm to execute the maximum number of steps. (A) Linear (B) Quasi-linear (C) Quadratic [5 marks] (b) Characterize the following statements regarding Big-O notation as “True” or “False”. Note that no justification is required. (i) 3𝑛2 = 𝑂(𝑛2) (ii) 𝑛 − 7 = 𝑂(𝑛) (iii) 2𝑛3 + 𝑛2 log(𝑛) = 𝑂(𝑛3) (iv) 100 = 𝑂(1) (v) log(𝑛) = 𝑂(𝑛) [5 marks] February Diet 3 Continued Overleaf/ (c) Let 𝐴 be an be an array of integers, whose elements are already sorted in ascending order. The length of 𝐴 is 𝑛. Assume that, for any integer 𝑖 such that 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛, we can query the value of the 𝑖-th element of array 𝐴, namely 𝐴[𝑖], and this operation costs a single computational step. You are now given an integer value 𝑘. Explain why it is possible to check whether an element of 𝐴 has value 𝑘 by performing at most 𝑂(log(𝑛)) steps. [4 marks] February Diet 4 Continued Overleaf/ Question 2 – Data Collections and Graphs (20 marks in total) 2. (a) Recall that 𝒫(𝑆) denotes the powerset of a set 𝑆. You are given sets 𝑋 = {1, 3, 5}, 𝑌 = {3, 7}, and 𝑍 = {2, 6, 8}. Determine the following (no justification needed): (i) 𝑋 ∪ 𝑌 [1 mark] (ii) |𝑋 × 𝑌| [1 mark] (iii) |𝑌 − 𝑋| [1 mark] (iv) 𝒫(𝑌) ∪ 𝑌 [1 mark] (v) |𝒫(𝑋 ∪ 𝑍)| [1 mark] (b) Consider the following graphs 𝐺1 and 𝐺2: 𝐺1 𝐺2 February Diet 5 Continued Overleaf/ Choose the right answer below. The following matrix is the adjacency matrix of: I. only graph 𝐺1 II. only graph 𝐺2 III. both graphs 𝐺1 and 𝐺2 IV. none of the above. There is no need to justify your answer, but wrong answers get a negative mark of -1. [3 marks] (c) Let function 𝑓: ℕ ⟶ ℕ defined by 𝑓(𝑛) = 2 𝑛 , where ℕ = {0,1, 2, 3, … } are the natural numbers. (i) What it the preimage of 64? What is the preimage of 𝑓(4176)? [2 marks] (ii) Is 𝑓 one-to-one? Is 𝑓 onto? Is 𝑓 bijective? Is 𝑓 invertible? Justify each of your answers. [4 marks] (iii) Let 𝑔: ℕ ⟶ [0, ∞) be the function defined by 𝑔(𝑛) = log2 𝑛. Determine the composite functions 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 and 𝑔 ∘ 𝑓. [2 marks] February Diet 6 Continued Overleaf/ (d) You are given the following graph: (i) Explain why this graph is a tree. [1 mark] (ii) Is this a binary tree? Justify your answer. [1 mark] (iii) Is the tree (when rooted at node 15) a binary search tree (BST)? Justify your answer. [1 mark] (iv) Is the tree (when rooted at node 15) balanced? Justify your answer. [1 mark] February Diet 7 Continued Overleaf/ Question 3 – Sequences, Induction, Recursion, and Counting (20 marks in total) 3. (a) Is it true that the following inequality holds for all positive integers 𝑛? 2 𝑛+1 ≤ (𝑛 + 1)2 Justify your answer. [4 marks] (b) Let {𝑎𝑛} be the sequence defined by the recurrence relation 𝑎𝑛 = 3𝑎𝑛−1, and the initial condition 𝑎0 = 1 81. Find a closed-form formula for the sequence {𝑎𝑛}, using the iterative method. [5 marks] (c) Using mathematical induction, prove that the following inequality holds for all positive integers 𝑛: 3 1 + 3 3 + 3 5 + ⋯ + 3 2𝑛 − 1 ≤ 𝑛 + 2. [6 marks] (d) In the 4 th year at the University of Glasgow students must take exactly 6 courses over two semesters. They have the choice of taking 3 or 4 courses from a set of 8 courses in semester 1, and 2 or 3 courses from a different set of 9 courses in semester 2. In how many ways can a student satisfy these requirements? Explain your answer, including the rules used and showing some calculations (final numeric result is not required). [5 marks] February Diet 8 /END Question 4 – Probability and Formal Reasoning (20 marks in total) 4. (a) What is the conditional probability that a randomly generated bit string of length 8 contains at least 6 consecutive 0’s, given that the last (or rightmost) bit is 1? Explain your answer. [5 marks] (b) Using either a truth table or the laws of logical equivalence, show that the following equivalence is valid: (¬p ∨ (¬q ∧p)) ≡ p → ¬q. If using the laws of logical equivalence, state the law you have used at each step. [4 marks] (c) Suppose the domains of discourse are S for students and F for faculty members (e.g., lecturers and advisers of studies) and we have the following predicates: G(x): x is a student in the Graduate Apprenticeship in Software Engineering (GA) programme. L(y): y is a lecturer in the GA programme. A(y,x): y is the advisor of studies for x. H(x): x is an Honours student.
