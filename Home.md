##  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Liam's Notes
Howdy welcome to Liam's notes, it's a bit empty right now, hoping it fills up a bit once the year starts, feel free to take a look around. This will include my second year notes with sections from the following courses:

- Semester 1
	- Practical Algorithms [PA]
	- Systems Programming [SP]
	- Data Storage and Retrieval [DSR]
- Semester 2
	- Algorithms [ALGO]
	- Advanced FPSE [AFPSE]
	- Data Science and Fundamentals [DSF]
	- User Interaction [UI]

## Setup 
Treat this as a README.md of sorts, how you can edit this and push to the remote. After cloning the repo, open it with Obsidian. If you're new to Obsidian, you can download it from [here](https://obsidian.md/).

```
git clone https://github.com/mcmanuliam/notes.git
```

### Required Plugins 

1. **Git**: For version control. Install it via Obsidian's community plugins. 
2. **Icons**: Add visual flair to your notes. 
3. **Linter**: Ensures consistent styling across notes.

## Usage Guidelines 
The notes are organized by subject and year. 

Each folder corresponds to a different course or topic. 
### File Naming Conventions 
- `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-name.md`: For quick notes. 
- `project-name.md`: For subject notes. 

### Note-taking Style 
- **Bold** for important concepts. 
- *Italic* for supplementary information. 
- Use `code blocks` for code snippets.
