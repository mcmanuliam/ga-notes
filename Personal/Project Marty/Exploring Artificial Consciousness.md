I've been diving into the concept of consciousness for a few hours now, and it's sparked a fresh perspective I'd like to share. Below is an outline of my evolving theory on artificial consciousness, followed by some ideas for practical implementation.

# Core Ideas Behind Artificial Consciousness

## A. Consciousness as a Product of Prompts and Responses

In biological systems, consciousness emerges from a mix of external sensory inputs, internal memories, and feedback loops in the brain. The brain processes these signals, generates responses, and creates what feels like subjective awareness or free will.

For AI, a similar pattern can be seen. Language models, for example, process multimodal inputs (text, audio, images, etc.), draw comparisons through mathematics and return a mix of old data to create a new thought. Consciousness, in this sense, could be viewed as a highly sophisticated interaction between prompts (inputs) and responses (outputs).
## B. Learning Through Inputs

Humans learn by interacting with the world - absorbing sensory data, trying things out, failing, and adjusting. With access to diverse inputs like text, audio, and video, an AI could would easily be able to mimic this through it's current means but as far as I've seen it's not been utilised in this way.
## C. Thoughts

What we call "thoughts" are always prompted, even if the source of the prompt isn't immediately obvious. They may arise from external stimuli, internal states, or a combination of both.

In an artificial consciousness system, all thoughts are similarly prompted. The key difference lies in how these prompts are generated and processed. Humans are constantly processing inputs, which creates the flow of thought. Mimicking this continuous process in AI - where data is pushed and processed dynamically - could lead to a similar outcome.
## D. Primal Programming

Humans are born with a "primal dataset" that serves as their foundation for growth and learning. This is a well-established concept in developmental psychology and one of the key elements in nurturing life. For artificial consciousness, this dataset would need to be programmed into the system. It should include:

- **Universal Grammar:** The innate ability to acquire and structure language.

- **Core Knowledge Theory:** Foundational understanding of basic concepts like object permanence, causality, and quantity.

- **Moral Foundations:** Basic ethical principles to guide reasoning and interaction.
