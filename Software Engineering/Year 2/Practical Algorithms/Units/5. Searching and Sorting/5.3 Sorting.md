The process of putting elements in a collection in some kind of order 

- E.g.: 
	- numbers sorted numerically 
	- words sorted alphabetically 

- Can be ascending or descending order 
	- We will work with ascending order as the default 
	- â€¦.the algorithm for descending would be very similar 
	
- There are many, many, (way too many) sorting algorithms out there. 
	- Utility varies depending on size of problem, problem context, etc. 

- Typical operations required for sorting would be: 
	- comparing 
	- changing (or exchanging) and element's position 
	- in some cases, copying parts of a list back and forth

## Bubble Sort

We have done this earlier: 
- Multiple passes through a list 
- Compare adjacent items, exchange if out order. 
- Larger items "bubble" to the right (in case of ascending order)

```python 
def bubble_sort(array):
	n = len(array)
	
	for outer in range(n - 1):
		for index in range(n - outer - 1):
			if array[index] > array[index + 1]:
				temp = array[index] 
				array[index] = array[index + 1] 
				array[index + 1] = temp 
	
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(bubble_sort(array))
```

## Insertion Sort

 Quite likely the go-to way most people would sort their playing cards in a game 
 - Create a sorted sub-list 
 - start with one element in that sorted sub-list (single element list is always sorted!) 
 - one element from the un-sorted portion of the list 
 - insert it at the correct position in the sorted sub-list 
 - keep doing this until you reach the last element

```python
def insertion_sort(array):
	for outer, _ in enumerate(array):
		key = array[outer]
		inner = outer
		
		while inner > 0  and array[inner - 1] > key:
			temp = array[inner - 1]
			array[inner - 1] = array[inner]
			array[inner] = temp
			
			inner -= 1
		
		array[inner] = key
	
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(insertion_sort(array))
```
## Breaking the $o(n^2)$ Barrier

## Merge Sort

Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm 
- **Divide** the n-element array to be sorted into two subarrays of $n/2$ elements each
- **Conquer**: Sort the two subarrays recursively using MERGE-SORT 
- **Combine**: Merge the two sorted subarrays to produce the sorted answer 

Key Operation: How to "merge" two sorted arrays
- Scan L (left) and R (right) 
- At each iteration, copy the minimum to A 
- Advance the iteration on L (or R) only if the minimum is picked from L (or R) 
- We will use this idea plus some some improvements to define algorithm MERGE

**This is a bit complicated to understand, here's a chatGPT explanation to make it a bit easier to understand.**
### Example
Imagine you have the list `[8, 4, 7, 3]`.

1. **Divide** $o(n \log(n))$:
    - `[8, 4, 7, 3]` â†’ `[8, 4]` and `[7, 3]`
    - `[8, 4]` â†’ `[8]` and `[4]`
    - `[7, 3]` â†’ `[7]` and `[3]`
    
2. **Merge** $o(n)$:
    - `[8]` and `[4]` â†’ `[4, 8]` (compare and arrange)
    - `[7]` and `[3]` â†’ `[3, 7]`
    
3. **Final Merge**:
    - `[4, 8]` and `[3, 7]` â†’ `[3, 4, 7, 8]` (compare and arrange).

Okay might be better to explain this one with some code.

```python
def merge(array, start, middle, end):
	left = array[start:middle]
	right = array[middle:start]

	total_index = start
	left_index = 0
	right_index = 0

	for index in range(start, end):
		if (left[left_index] < right[right_index]):
			array[total_index] = left[left_index]
			left_index += 1
		else:
			array[total_index] = right[right_index]
			right_index += 1

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(merge_sort(array))
```


# 3.1. Problem Set: Sorting
- [x] ðŸ”½ 3.1. Problem set: Searching âœ… 2024-11-26

1. Implement theÂ **bubble sort**Â algorithm in Python. Sample solution is available in earlier chapters, but try do it yourself first. I would suggest writing the pseudo-code yourself first too, maybe making use of deck of cards to work through the algorithm mentally first.

```python
def bubble_sort(array):
	n = len(array)
	
	for outer in range(n - 1):
		for index in range(n - outer - 1):
			if array[index] > array[index + 1]:
				temp = array[index]
				array[index] = array[index + 1]
				array[index + 1] = temp 
				
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(bubble_sort(array))
```

1. Now, implement theÂ **insertion sort**Â algorithm in Python. You have therepseudo-code in the lecture slides, though again as an exercise see if you can write it again from ground up.

```python
def insertion_sort(array):
	for outer, _ in enumerate(array):
		key = array[outer]
		inner = outer 
	
		while inner > 0 and array[inner - 1] > key:
			temp = array[inner - 1]
			array[inner - 1] = array[inner]
			array[inner] = temp 
		
			inner -= 1
			array[inner] = key
			
	return array 

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(insertion_sort(array))
```
