**For transactions it's already used heavily on the platform and the app, think about sign-up tokens or stripe handling. Views are most likely similar to how we handle policies in the middleware**

- Database Systems are normally being accessed by many users or processes at the same time.
	- Both queries and modifications

- Unlike operating systems, which support interaction of processes, a DBMS needs to safeguard processes from troublesome interactions.

#### Controlled Concurrent Access

- Two people try to access bank account and withdraw money at the same time, leads to Race condition.

- We can get around this by using Transactions -

### Transactions

```javascript
// Mongo Code to create a transaction, not 100% transferable but it gives a good idea of how this will work.
const session = client.startSession();  
  
try {  
  session.startTransaction();  
  
  // Decrease Alice's balance  
  const alice = db.users.findOne({ name: "Alice" }, { session });  
  db.users.updateOne(  
    { name: "Alice" },  
    { $inc: { balance: -30 } },  
    { session }  
  );  
  
  // Increase Bob's balance  
  const bob = db.users.findOne({ name: "Bob" }, { session });  
  db.users.updateOne(  
    { name: "Bob" },  
    { $inc: { balance: 30 } },  
    { session }  
  );  
  
  // Commit the transaction  
  session.commitTransaction();  
  console.log("Transaction committed successfully.");  
} catch (error) {  
  console.log("Transaction failed. Rolling back.");  
  session.abortTransaction();  
} finally {  
  session.endSession();  
}
```

- Transaction = Process involving database queries and/or modification.
- Normally with some strong properties regarding concurrency.
- Formed in SQL from single statements.

- **ACID transactions are:**
	- ***Atomic***: Whole transaction or none is done
	- ***Consistent***: Database constraints preserved.
	- ***Isolated***: It appears to the user as if only one process executes at a time
	- ***Durable***: Effects of a process survive a crash.


## Transaction Operations
An DBMS keeps track of when a transaction **starts**, **terminates**, and **commits** or **aborts**.

To do this, a recovery manager process tracks the following operations: 

- BEGIN_TRANSACTION
- READ or WRITE
- END_TRANSACTION
- COMMIT_TRANSACTION
- ROLLBACK

##### COMMIT
The SQL statement COMMIT causes a transaction to complete. 

- It's database modifications are now permanent in the database.

```javascript
session.commitTransaction();
```

##### ROLLBACK
 The SQL statement ROLLBACK also causes the transaction to end, but by aborting. 

 - No effects on the database. 
 - Failures like division by 0 or a constraint violation can also cause rollback, even if the programmer does not request it.

```javascript
session.abortTransaction();
```

### Isolation Levels
SQL defines four *isolation levels*
###### 1. READ UNCOMMITTED
- Transactions can see uncommitted changes from others, allows **Dirty Reads** - Reading data that may later be rolled back.
###### 2. READ COMMITTED
- Transactions can only see committed changes. **Non-Repeatable Reads** - The same data might change if read again.
###### 3. REPEATABLE READ
- Transactions see the same data on repeated reads.**Phantom Reads** - New rows may appear if data is queried again. Ensures consistent data for repeated reads.
###### 4. SERIALIZABLE
- Transactions act like they run one at a time (fully isolated). Can cause for performance issues. For maximum accuracy, e.g., banking.

###### IN USE
Your choice, e.g., run serializable, affects only how you see the database, not how others see it.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Perform operations
COMMIT;
```

## Views
Essentially just policies, a query to determine what certain people can see.

```sql
CREATE VIEW CanDrink AS
	SELECT drinker, beer 
	FROM Frequents, Sells 
	WHERE Frequents.bar = Sells.bar;
```
